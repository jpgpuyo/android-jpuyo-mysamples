My samples
===========

Sometimes, I want to do some experiments with new libraries or learn new things,
and I don't want create the whole project from the scratch because I am a little lazy :)

So, I have created a project to reduce the time spent creating a sample.

I have implemented a minimal architecture because sometimes I want to test if
a specific library or component is well isolated from android framework,
but in this project, architecture is not important, except when sample is related to architecture.
